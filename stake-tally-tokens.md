# ♨ Stake Tally Tokens

### Earn Interest (APY)

When you stake Tally Tokens, you are rewarded more Tally Tokens.  Please check [Pools](https://app.tally-ho.org/pools/stake\_tally) to find the current % rate of rewards.  Although the interest rate is shown as an Annual Percentage Rate (APR), users are offered an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) feature to help maximise earnings through manual recycling.\
\
**What is APY?**\
\
APY is the same as APR but with compound interest added on.  The reason the APY is not displayed on Tally Pools is because stakers have the freedom to decide how often they would like to compound their tokens for higher rewards.  The APY rate depends on compound frequency.

#### Example of APY @60% APR

<mark style="color:blue;">Users compound manually on the platform</mark>

* **User compounds once per day:** <mark style="color:green;">APY = 82.12%</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark>&#x20;
* **User compounds once per week:** <mark style="color:green;">APY = 81.59%</mark>
* **User compounds once per month:** <mark style="color:green;">APY = 79.59%</mark>
* **User compounds quarterly:** <mark style="color:green;">APY = 74.9%</mark>
* **User compounds once per year:** <mark style="color:green;">APY = 60%</mark> (this is what banks offer you for your savings)\


### Tally Pools

Tally Exchange has one of the highest APR rates in the business due to the ecosystem supporting the token.&#x20;

With the added focus on constant marketing, product development, partnerships and a buy back mechanism, there is a performance fee attached to staking in order to support the protocol.&#x20;

Keeping in line with competitors, Tally staking fees are capped at 2%.  Current rate at 0.4%.\
\
**Unstaking fee**

<mark style="color:blue;">0.4%</mark>

Tally Exchange does not require users to lock in their funds when staking.  Many exchanges have a penalty fee for withdrawing early as a forfeit, this is necessary for stability and safety.\
&#x20;\
There is a un-staking fee attached to staking which is small enough to be recoupable within days of staking.&#x20;

Stake tokens and within a short length of time, stakers start to earn more than the un-stake fee and start seeing gains.  Similar staking platforms apply a 72 hour minimum lock time.

**Performance fee**

0.4%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest.

For example, if the harvest were 1000 TALLY, then 4 TALLY would be subtracted as the performance fee.

The TALLY collected via the un-staking fee and performance fee is directed towards marketing, maintenance and operations, and buyback reserves.\
\
This is a good thing for TALLY holders because it supports the token and helps to bring Tally Token to a wider audience by increasing awareness and growing the community.
