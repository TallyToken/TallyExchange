# üì• How To Add Liquidity

When you add liquidity to the pool, you will get LP tokens. When someone makes a token swap, a transaction fee of 0.1% will be charged. 0.05% will be returned to liquidity providers in the form of a fee reward. The liquidity pool will also allow you to stake your LP tokens to earn BSW tokens in the ‚ÄúFarms‚Äù. Hence, apart from earning income from token swap transactions, a user will be able to stake LP tokens and earn BSW tokens.&#x20;

> _For instance, if you add liquidity to $BNB / $BUSD, you will receive BNB-BUSD LP tokens. The number of LP tokens you receive represents your share in BNB-BUSD liquidity pool. You can always request the withdrawal of your funds by removing your liquidity._

Please note that when adding liquidity you will need to have a sufficient amount of each token. Let‚Äôs say you want to add the following liquidity: 1 BNB / 308 BUSD. If you have less than 308 BUSD or less than 1 BNB, you will not be able to proceed. You need to have a sufficient amount of each token.&#x20;

‚ùóÔ∏è **We use WBNB on the BEP-20 network, Binance Smart Chain. So BNB (BEP-2) tokens need to be wrapped (become WBNB) to provide liquidity. You may wrap BNB to WBNB by making a swap on the** [**Exchange**](https://exchange.biswap.org/#/swap) **tab.**

**Note, you need to have BNB to pay the network gas fee.**

you can provide liquidity for BNB-BSW tokens in the farming pair.

1. Enter the equivalent amount of each token from the farming pair and click the **Approve WBNB** button

Also, the impermanent loss displays how much more money a user would have had if he/she didn‚Äôt provide liquidity and instead held onto their assets.

Undoubtedly, the DeFi is changing the world of finances in a variety of positive ways. However, no one is insured against possible risks connected with impermanent loss.
