# ðŸª™ Why Buy Tally Token?

<mark style="color:blue;">The short answer:  Because it is unlike other tokens.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The fuller answer:  See below</mark>

### The Tokenomics

![BUY and SELL % can alter slightly to encourage buying pressure.  It will never go beyond 20%](<.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png>)

**Total Supply:**  1,000,000,000       There is a limit.\
_<mark style="color:blue;">Only one billion Tally Tokens will ever exist.  Tally Tokens cannot be created, printed or minted.</mark>_\
_<mark style="color:blue;">Where there is scarcity there is value.</mark>_

### Passive Income <mark style="color:green;">(Reflections)</mark>

Tally Token is not unique with its passive income feature.  The difference is found in the route Tally Token is navigating in order to achieve passive income for holders.\
\
Each time Tally Token is purchased, every holder receives a share of the purchase which counts as your passive income.  \
\
Passive income is sent to your wallet instantly.  You will see the amount of tokens in your wallet increase in real time.

### Staking Tally Tokens

**Looking for a way to earn interest?**  _Take a look at staking options._\

_<mark style="color:blue;">Rates are incredible but most importantly, they are real.</mark>_\
\
Tally makes more Tally.  Staking is another way to see your tokens grow and grow.  This is comparable to generating interest.  As a reward for being part of the Tally Token Community and locking your tokens in a Tally Pool, you are rewarded with more Tally Tokens.  You are looking at APR rates 25%-90%+ dependent on how soon you enter the pool.  In any case, it is far higher than any bank or financial institution product.\
\
<mark style="color:blue;">What can you do with your token rewards?</mark>&#x20;

1. **Harvest**\
   Only withdraw the interest and keep _the rest of your tokens in the pool generating more rewards._
2. **Compound**\
   _Take your rewards and add it to your principal stake.  This allows you to generate even more interest  because your principal is higher.  You are able to compound your rewards as often as you like, it is a manual process._
3. **Cash Out - Take it all**\
   _Of course keeping your tokens staked is what we the community would like all holders to do. The high rates is a good reason to do so.  However, it is no secret that the whole objective of staking is to make gains and enjoy the profits._ _You can withdraw your stake and rewards at any time.  Locking tokens is not a requirement on Tally Exchange.  Removing tokens can be done at any time._
