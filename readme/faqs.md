# ‚ùì FAQs

**What is it to be a provider - Am I giving my tokens away for a percentage of trading fees?**

<mark style="color:blue;">No, you are not giving your tokens away.  Liquidity Providers are not giving away their tokens.  The value of tokens that providers input is the same value providers will receive on output when tokens are withdrawn.</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;">The principle deposit (the liquidity provided) is redeemable.  The earnings made from trading fees are the profits rewarded for providing tokens.</mark> &#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">Although the principle value is redeemable, the token ratio that the provider deposits may be returned in a different ratio, but still amounting to the same value.  This is dependent on the activity of trades in the associated pool.</mark>

#### Different Types of Liquidity Providers

<mark style="color:blue;">Banks, institutions and currency bureaus are in the business of providing liquidity; this is a lucrative way of using money to make money.</mark>

* Instead of leaving tokens in a wallet doing absolutely nothing but going up and down in value.  Parking your tokens on Tally Exchange puts your tokens to work.  It allows the exchange to use your tokens for others to trade.  Supply and demand can earn you a passive income by receiving a portion of trading fees.\
  <mark style="color:blue;">Useful for those tokens you plan to hold for a while.   Let those tokens work for you in the meantime.</mark>
* Some Liquidity Providers are seeking passive income streams.  In addition to using tokens they already hold, they also provide token pairs that are popular trades.  This is an opportunity to earn from high trade volume.

<mark style="color:blue;">Whereas with centralised exchanges propped by big backers who earn big profits, Tally Exchange is a peer-to-peer decentralised platform bringing opportunities for the general public.</mark>  \ <mark style="color:blue;">It allows the masses to practise similar activities with their funds.  Decentralised Exchanges allow the people to provide tokens to each other without an intermediate or broker.</mark>

#### I don't have enough to become a Liquidity Provider

<mark style="color:blue;">Affordability was one of the prime purposes when developing Tally.  If it were true that you cannot make use of the features provided, this would be a project failure.</mark>   \ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;">This is where you find the difference with platforms that are built with affordability in mind for the people.  It is not about how much the individual has, or how much one individual can add to liquidity.  It is about how many people can add together as a community working together providing and swapping; the exchange will run itself.</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>You can add as little or as much as you can afford.  There is no minimum or limit.
