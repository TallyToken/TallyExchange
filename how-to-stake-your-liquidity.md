# ‚ô® How to stake your Liquidity

Start Passive BSW Income in a Wink!

Have you caught the thought of getting crypto in a way of passive income, little effort, and a few seconds? Such beneficial earnings can come true on **Biswap Farms**! In this article, you will find out useful information about farming with all the details and clear examples.

To begin with, **Farming** is a passive income opportunity that allows you to multiply crypto with **high APRs** by providing liquidity to a chosen pair of tokens.

Once you have provided the liquidity on Biswap you get **LP tokens** which can be later staked to **Enable Farm** and bring you **BSW rewards.** Let‚Äôs dive into details and see the examples.

Now, we will go over the step-by-step guide with the screenshots so you can gain a better understanding of farming on Biswap. The **BNB-BSW Farming Pair** will play a role as a sample for this guide.

### &#x20;<a href="#provide-liquidity-stake-lp-tokens-and-earn-bsw" id="provide-liquidity-stake-lp-tokens-and-earn-bsw"></a>

As you noticed there are two tokens in a farming pair. In order to enable any farming pair on Biswap, you need to have LP tokens that could be obtained via liquidity provision on the platform.

The liquidity needs to be provided for two tokens in a farming pair that you wish to start, let‚Äôs say it is BNB-BSW:

1.  2\.

    Find **BNB-BSW Farming Pair** and click the _**Get LP**_ button

You will be automatically transferred to the [**Liquidity page**](https://exchange.biswap.org/#/pool) on Biswap where you can provide liquidity for BNB-BSW tokens in the farming pair.

3\. **** Enter the equivalent amount of each token from the farming pair and click the **Approve WBNB** button

‚ùóÔ∏è **We use WBNB on the BEP-20 network, Binance Smart Chain. So BNB (BEP-2) tokens need to be wrapped (become WBNB) to provide liquidity. You may wrap BNB to WBNB by making a swap on the** [**Exchange**](https://exchange.biswap.org/#/swap) **tab.**

**Note, you need to have BNB to pay the network gas fee.**

As you already know, to become a liquidity provider you need to add liquidity on Biswap. A liquidity provider receives:

üí∏ **Passive income on Farms:**

Get **passive income in BSW** for the LP-staking on Biswap Farms with a **high APR**.

üí∏ **The** **50% from the Trading Fee**: A total of **0.05%** in the form of a **Fee Reward** from the Trading fee of **0.1%** is sent to Liquidity providers when someone makes a swap on the Biswap platform with a certain farming pair.

It is a quite beneficial method to maximize crypto, right? So, rush to become a liquidity provider and get profitable rewards!

### &#x20;<a href="#what-is-impermanent-loss" id="what-is-impermanent-loss"></a>

Any trading pair can be impacted by volatility. Therefore, liquidity providers might occasionally experience a temporary loss of their funds.

Also, the impermanent loss displays how much more money a user would have had if he/she didn‚Äôt provide liquidity and instead held onto their assets.

Undoubtedly, the DeFi is changing the world of finances in a variety of positive ways. However, no one is insured against possible risks connected with impermanent loss.
