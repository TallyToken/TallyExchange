# üì• How To Add Liquidity

When you add liquidity to the pool, you will get LP tokens. When someone makes a token swap, a transaction fee of 0.1% will be charged. 0.05% will be returned to liquidity providers in the form of a fee reward. The liquidity pool will also allow you to stake your LP tokens to earn BSW tokens in the ‚ÄúFarms‚Äù. Hence, apart from earning income from token swap transactions, a user will be able to stake LP tokens and earn BSW tokens.

### Adding Liquidity

Liquidity Providers receive a LP Token representing the tokens provided. LP Tokens are used to redeem provided tokens.\
When traders swap tokens on TallySWAP, a transaction fee of 0.4% will be charged. 0.17% will be returned to liquidity providers as passive income.\
\
The liquidity pool will also allow you to stake your LP tokens to earn Tally Tokens in the ‚ÄúFarms‚Äù. What does this mean? Liquidity Providers have up to <mark style="color:orange;">**three**</mark> streams of passive income:

1. Income from trading fees (TallySWAP)
2. Income from Farming (LP Staking earns Tally Tokens)
3. Income from Staking earned Tally Token rewards (Tally Staking Pools)

Example of Adding Liquidity

> _If you choose to add liquidity of $BNB / $BUSD, you will receive BNB-BUSD LP tokens. The number of LP tokens you receive represents your share in BNB-BUSD liquidity pool. You can always request the withdrawal of your funds by removing your liquidity._

When you add liquidity, not that you need to have a sufficient amount of each token. It works in pairs and directly corrolates to the pairs traders swap when selling and purchasing tokens on TallySWAP.\
ie. Picture the following; 1 BNB / 308 BUSD. If you have less than 308 BUSD or less than 1 BNB, you won't be able to add the liquidity. You will not be allowed to proceed further. You need to have a sufficient amount of each token.

‚ùóÔ∏è **We use WBNB on the BEP-20 network, Binance Smart Chain. So BNB (BEP-2) tokens need to be wrapped (become WBNB) to provide liquidity. You may wrap BNB to WBNB by making a swap on the** [**Exchange**](https://exchange.biswap.org/#/swap) **tab.**

As described above with token pair balancing. Enter the equivalent amount of each token from the farming pair and click the <mark style="color:green;">**Approve WBNB**</mark> button

Adding Liquidity to Tally Exchange follows the same principle as adding on Pancakeswap. See video as guidance based on Pancakeswap

All being well, you have supplied liquidity of the pair and ready to receive your portion of trades on that pair. You will receive LP Tokens of **BNB-TALLY.** From here, you can use these LP Tokens and stake them in the Farm and earn Tally Token as rewards at a APR far higher than banks give as interest.
